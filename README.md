# API - KG for Goal Model Generation

## Requirements

Python 3.9 / 3.10 / 3.11

## How to install the tool

### Create an environment to install the tool (facilitates uninstallation)

```shell
python -m venv kgforgoalmodel
```

### Activate the environment

If you are using Windows:

* In cmd.exe

```shell
kgforgoalmodel\Scripts\activate.bat
```

* In PowerShell

```shell
kgforgoalmodel\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

------

If you are using Linux or MacOS:

```shell
source kgforgoalmodel/bin/activate
```

### Installing the dependencies

```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Advanced configuration for hardware acceleration

If your computer has an NVidia GPU with CUDA installed, you can complete your installation by re-installing PyTorch 
using a command line generated by [this form](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/#start-locally). Choose "Stable"
as the PyTorch build, "Pip" as the package and "Python as the Language", complete with the relevant OS and CUDA version
for your computer.

If you do not know whether you have CUDA installed or not, or you don't know the version, you can check using this command:

```shell
nvcc --version
```

If you do not want to install CUDA or do not have an NVIDIA GPU, **please ignore this instruction**.

### Run the tool

```shell
uvicorn main:app
```

The tool is then accessible by opening a webpage at the URL [127.0.0.1:8000](http://127.0.0.1:8000) or [localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)

### At the beginning of your experiment

* Note the start time (Reminder: the experiment is supposed to be completed in one session.)

### After the end of the experiment

* Take a screenshot of your goal model.
* Note the end time for your experiment.
* Close the terminal running the tool.
* Delete the whole folder for the experiment, it should now be quite heavy.
