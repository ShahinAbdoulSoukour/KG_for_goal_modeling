## Description

The algorithm incrementally constructs sets of triples (i-triples) and evaluates their entailment with the goal using a natural language inference (NLI) model.
In this approach, **G2T is not used**.

### Key concepts
i-Triple (T)

A set of i triples, composed of:
- One anchor triple
- Up to i-1 neighbor triples (context)

### Key features
Each anchor triple is evaluated against the goal using a NLI model:
- If entailing, it is stored and marked as retained.
- If non-entailing, context expansion begins.

#### Context Expansion for Non-Entailing Triples
- The non-entailing anchor forms a 1-triple T.
- Neighbor triples are ranked by similarity. A beam width of top candidates is selected.
- For each neighbor triple n:
  - If T ∪ {n} is already in ENT and entailing → skip.
  - If n itself is entailing → exclude and expand beam.
  - Sentiment-prefixed if needed.
  - Evaluate T ∪ {n}:
    - If entailing, check if any subset that includes n is also entailing → retain the smallest entailing subset.
    - If none are entailing but score improves, continue expanding the triple set with more neighbors (up to a depth limit).


### General Step
Repeats the same logic for existing i-triples (i > 1):
- Add a new neighbor n.
- Skip if any subset including n is already entailing.
- Evaluate T ∪ {n} and its subsets.
- Retain the smallest subset if entailing.
- If score improves, continue expansion.
